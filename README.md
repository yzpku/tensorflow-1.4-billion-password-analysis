## Deep Learning

- Stay tuned!

### Map the password list for each email

Generate the JSON files containing emails <-> list of passwords. Output folder is `~/BreachCompilationAnalysis`.

```
python3 read.py --breach_compilation_folder ~/BreachCompilation
```
 
- Make sure you have enough free memory (8GB should be enough).
- It took 1h30m to run on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6900K CPU @ 3.20GHz (on a single thread).
- Uncompressed output is 13G.

Output is of the form:

```
> less ReducePasswordsOnSimilarEmailsCallback-z-b.json # emails starting with zb.
{
    "zb-email1@yahoo.com": [
        "pass1",
        "pass2"
    ],
    "zb-email2@yahoo.com": [
        "pass1",
        "pass2",
        "pass3"
    ],
    [...]
}
```
